/// defines them.
///
/// The historical bytes are the part that identifies a card across every
/// way of reaching it. One card answers differently on each interface
/// and through each reader -- a contact answer to reset frames them one
/// way, a card's own ATS another, and a PC/SC reader synthesizes a third
/// -- while the historical bytes inside are the same.
///
/// They have to be parsed rather than found. The obvious shortcut is to
/// search for the `80` category byte and take everything after it, and
/// it is wrong: two of the cards DVV issues carry an `80` among their
/// interface bytes, so the search finds that one and returns a string
/// that begins in the middle of the header. That mistake was made once
/// while this was being written, which is why the structure is walked
/// properly here.
///
/// The walk: `TS` names the convention, `T0` carries how many historical
/// bytes there are in its low nibble and which interface bytes follow in
/// its high nibble, and each `TD` byte says the same about the group
/// after it. Skip those groups and the historical bytes are what remain,
/// however many `T0` promised.
