/// an end-of-file status, or the aggregate cap. Reading a short chunk as
/// the end of the file is only honest while the transport can carry a
/// full chunk home, so the chunk length is not a constant here but a
/// `ReadChunkLength` the transport chooses; the default is the plain
/// chunk every contact read has always used. `.singleDerObject` reads
/// exactly the one DER object at the file's start: once the object's
/// header is in hand its declared length becomes the cap, so the final
/// chunk asks for exactly the remaining bytes. That matters because the
/// card refuses a READ BINARY whose length overruns the file - it
/// returns end-of-file with zero bytes rather than a partial - so a
/// certificate (whose DER is shorter than the padded EF) must be read to
/// its exact size or it comes back truncated.
///
/// The assembler performs no I/O. `nextStep` says what to do; every
/// `transmit` response is fed back through `accept(_:)`. This keeps the
/// continuation logic fully testable without a card and lets the
