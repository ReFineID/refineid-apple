/// What the app learned about one card while priming it, so a later
/// signature does not have to learn it again.
///
/// Except for the CAN described below, the material here is public and
/// unchanging: the certificate the card holds, the chain above it, and
/// the card's own serial. None of it can differ the next time the same
/// card is read, so re-reading it buys nothing -- and it is not free. On
/// the contactless path the read costs hundreds of milliseconds of
/// secure-messaged APDUs at exactly the moment the field is shortest:
/// `ctkd` owns the slot and ends the session about two seconds after the
/// token is minted, and that read was measured dying part way through. A
/// signature that spends its field time re-reading a certificate it
/// already has is a login lost for nothing.
///
/// The card access number is the one value here that is not public. It is
/// carried as digits rather than as a `CardAccessNumber` because this
/// record is written to and read from the keychain, and the domain type
/// is deliberately not `Codable`; the digits are validated through that
/// type on the way in and on the way out, and they appear in no log line,
/// no description, and no error message.
///
/// Provenance: `PrimedIdentity` in the donor
/// `platform/apple/RefineIDTokenExtension/PrimeStore.swift` and its
/// hand-kept mirror `PrimedIdentityRecord` in
/// `platform/apple/RefineID/Local/SafariIdentityPrime+PrimeStore.swift`.
/// The two copies had to be kept in sync by review; this one record lives
/// in the module the app and the extension both link.
