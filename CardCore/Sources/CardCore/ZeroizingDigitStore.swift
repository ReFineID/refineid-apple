/// this store - for example the String the system PIN sheet delivered - are
/// outside its reach. What this store guarantees is that the digits it owns
/// do not outlive their use.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` is sound: `bytes` is set once at init (before the
/// store is shared) and mutated only in `deinit` (no concurrent access at
/// that point); every owner is either a noncopyable value with unique
/// ownership (`Pin1`, `Pin1Transmission`) or holds it behind a mutex
/// (`AcceptedPin1Memory`), so it is never mutated while shared.
