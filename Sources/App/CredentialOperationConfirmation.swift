/// give back, and the two forms differ by a single character - which
/// is exactly how a card ends up with a new PIN 1 when its holder
/// meant PIN 2. WCAG 3.3.4 accepts reversal, checking, or
/// confirmation; nothing about a card is reversible and no entry can
/// be checked before the card sees it, so confirmation is the only
/// one of the three available here.
///
/// The centered alert names the operation once, on its affirmative action. That
/// label is explicit for assistive technology and long enough for the system to
/// stack it above Cancel without a redundant question. A pristine credential needs
/// no warning; retry guidance appears only after one or two mistakes,
/// while the shared retry floor prevents a third. Cancel is the default
/// and destroys every secret held by the form.
