/// Two of these are contactless, and the difference between them decides
/// how a signature may be taken. A card on a reader's antenna sits in a
/// field the reader holds for as long as it likes, so a signature there
/// can afford everything the contact path does: read the serial, read
/// the counters, and reuse a card-bound PIN. A card held against a phone
/// does not have that: the system owns the slot, ends it about two
/// seconds after the mint, and every read spends field the signature
/// still needs -- so that path asks for the PIN before touching the card
/// and reads nothing it was not given.
///
/// Telling them apart by slot name was tried and is wrong: a reader
/// names its interfaces by a trailing index and never says which is the
/// antenna. This is recorded at the mint instead, by the code that
/// already knows which of the two ways it made the token.
