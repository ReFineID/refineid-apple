/// Diagnostic logging for the token extension.
///
/// The extension runs inside ctkd, where no debugger or probe reaches it,
/// so this is the only window into the real createToken/sign invocations.
/// Every line goes to os.Logger AND is appended to a file in the
/// extension's tmp dir, which is pullable over wireless without a USB swap:
///   xcrun devicectl device copy from --device <id> \
///     --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier fi.refineid.ReFineID.token \
///     --source tmp/refineid-token-extension.log --destination /tmp/trace.log
/// No PIN, PUK, full serial, or certificate content is ever logged - only
/// lengths, status words, and control flow (release plan section 4.3).
///
/// Debug and Profile builds only. A shipped build says nothing at all:
/// TestFlight and Release define no `DEBUG`, so every function here is
/// empty. Nothing is written to the system log, no file is created and
/// no keychain item is touched.
///
/// The message is an `@autoclosure` so that a shipped build does not
/// build a line nobody reads. A plain `String` was measured leaving
/// about twenty trace fragments in the optimized binary: an empty
/// inlined function removes the call, but not always the interpolation
/// that produced its argument. The Swift release manager's `inspect-archive`
/// command fails an archive in which any of them reappear.
///
/// One cost, worth knowing before writing a call: a closure formed in a
/// scope that consumes a noncopyable value makes Swift 6.3.3 report a
/// copy of a noncopyable value at the `consume`, and call it a compiler
/// bug. Take what the line needs into a copyable local first -
/// ``TokenSession/signInField(token:accessNumber:dataToSign:algorithm:)``
/// is the one place that has had to.
