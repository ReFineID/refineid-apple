/// This is a conformance test, not a self-consistency one, and the
/// distinction is the point. `PaceEstablishmentTests` runs a synthetic
/// card that computes with this same implementation, so both sides agree
/// even when both are wrong. The expectations below come from the Rust
/// reference's own assertions on real hardware
/// (`crates/refineid-lib-core/src/pace.rs`), so a divergence here is a
/// divergence from what the card accepts.
///
/// `@testable` is used deliberately: the encoder is internal, and the
/// alternative -- widening it to public so a test can see it -- would
/// change the module's surface to suit a test rather than a caller.
///
/// The token matters more than its size suggests: it is the message
/// whose MAC proves to the card that we hold the same keys. Encode it
/// differently and the card sees a wrong authentication token, which is
/// indistinguishable to it from a wrong card access number -- and cards
/// answer a suspected wrong password by getting slower.
